# Brief
- Your challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the Dictionary API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Your users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.
