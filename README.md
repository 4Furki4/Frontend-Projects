## Product Preview Card Component
### **Solved at 20.03.2023**
- Difficulties:
  - Font sizes and spacing between text had me have hard times :D I tried to make it as closer to the design as possible.
- What I Tried New:
  - I used scss in a project for the first time. It made project progress way much easier bc of nesting with & symbol.

### **Solved at 14.04.2023**
- Difficulties:
  - I think that it wasn't hard much, good practice though.
- What I Tried New:
  - I hadn't written client-side validation by myself before.
  - I learned that ``::placeholder`` exists xD
