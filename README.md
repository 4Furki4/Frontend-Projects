## Product Preview Card Component
- Difficulties:
  - Font sizes and spacing between text had me have hard times :D I tried to make it as closer to the design as possible.
- What I Tried New:
  - I used scss in a project for the first time. It made project progress way much easier bc of nesting with & symbol.
